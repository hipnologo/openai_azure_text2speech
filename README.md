# OpenAI and Azure for Text-to-Speech

This is a Python script that takes the URL of a webpage as a prompt, uses OpenAI's Davinci engine to generate text from the prompt, and converts the resulted text to speech using Azure's Text-to-Speech API. The script is built using `streamlit` to display the results in a web interface.
