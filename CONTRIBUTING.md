# Contributing to OpenAI & Azure Text-to-Speech Application

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the OpenAI & Azure Text-to-Speech Application! Hereâ€™s a guide to help you get started, including setup instructions, style guidelines, and testing information.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**:
   - Click on the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page.
   - This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Fork**:
   - Open a terminal and clone your fork:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/openai_azure_text2speech.git
     cd openai_azure_text2speech
     ```

3. **Create a Branch**:
   - Create a branch for your feature or bug fix. Using a branch keeps the `main` branch stable.
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
     ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure you have a `.env` file in the root directory with your API keys:
     ```plaintext
     OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
     AZURE_API_KEY=YOUR_AZURE_API_KEY
     ```

5. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install required dependencies in a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## Contribution Workflow

1. **Make Your Changes**:
   - Write clear, well-documented code.
   - Ensure your changes follow the coding standards outlined below.

2. **Write Tests**:
   - Write tests for new functionality or bug fixes to maintain code quality. 
   - We recommend using the `pytest` framework:
     ```bash
     pip install pytest
     pytest
     ```

3. **Check for Formatting Issues**:
   - Ensure code is formatted according to PEP 8 using `flake8` or `black`:
     ```bash
     pip install flake8 black
     flake8 .
     black .
     ```

4. **Commit Changes**:
   - Use descriptive commit messages. Aim to keep each commit focused and purposeful.
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Add feature: customizable text truncation"
     ```

5. **Push Changes**:
   - Push the changes to your branch on GitHub:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature/your-feature-name
     ```

6. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**:
   - Navigate to the original repository on GitHub and open a new PR from your branch.
   - Include a title, a description of changes, and any additional details that help explain the purpose and context of your work.

## Style Guide

Please ensure your contributions align with the following coding standards:

- **Python Style**: Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code.
- **Docstrings**: Include clear docstrings for each function and class using the Google style.
- **Comments**: Use comments to explain complex logic or workflows within the code.
- **Commit Messages**: Use descriptive messages (e.g., "Fix Azure API error handling").
- **File Organization**: Maintain modularity by creating new files for significant features or logically separate functionality.

---

## Testing Guidelines

Testing is essential to ensure that all features work as expected and that changes do not introduce bugs. Here are some testing guidelines:

- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for any new function or feature.
- **Functional Tests**: Test the functionality as part of the app's workflow, especially any user interface changes.
- **Run Tests Before PR**: Before creating a pull request, make sure all tests pass:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```

## Additional Resources

- **Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with `app.py` and `README.md` to understand the app's workflow and dependencies.
- **Questions**: If you have any questions, please open an issue or reach out to the maintainers.
